Description:
Cross-Chain Bridge Tracker is a Mini App that monitors activity, status, and transaction flows across major blockchain bridges. Track real-time bridge volume, delays, fees, and security alerts to ensure safe and efficient cross-chain transfers. Stay informed about bridge health and performance at all times.

Key Features:
 • Real-time monitoring of cross-chain bridge activity
 • Tracking of volume, fees, and transfer times
 • Alerts for delays, congestion, or security risks
 • Historical charts for bridge usage and performance
 • Dashboard for comparing multiple bridges across networks

Use Case:
Ideal for users who frequently move assets across chains and want to avoid delays, high fees, or potential security issues.

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact changes to the title and description. Once that file is available, I’ll also create the new `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file for the app logo.

A stylized illustration of a bridge connecting two blockchain networks, represented by two interlocking chain links on either side, with a translucent arch spanning between them. The bridge is rendered in a clean, flat design with a gradient of blue and teal colors, symbolizing connectivity and data flow. The background is a subtle gradient from light gray to white, giving a modern, tech‑savvy feel. The overall composition conveys real‑time monitoring and secure transfer across chains, with small symbols of a clock and a shield subtly integrated into the bridge to hint at speed and security.
