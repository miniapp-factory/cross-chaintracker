A stylized illustration of a bridge connecting two blockchain networks, represented by two interlocking chain links on either side, with a translucent arch spanning between them. The bridge is rendered in a clean, flat design with a gradient of blue and teal colors, symbolizing connectivity and data flow. The background is a subtle gradient from light gray to white, giving a modern, tech‑savvy feel. The overall composition conveys real‑time monitoring and secure transfer across chains, with small symbols of a clock and a shield subtly integrated into the bridge to hint at speed and security.
